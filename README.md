## NakedOptics_InstaGramFilter_inner


## Project Description

While your face is covered with the NakedOptic-Goggles, your nose will turn really red and icicles will be hanging down your nose. The Red color will be overlapped with your skin color, so it's more like blush, the icicles should look transparent and shouldn't be very long.
If it's possible to integrate Sound: it will make a sniff sound, like your nose is running in a unperiodical time lapse
## Visuals

## Secondary Ideas

Instagram Filter with Snowflakes in the background that fall down at the beginning of activating it. They fall down as long as the Face-Filter is activated. While the filter is activated, if you open your mouth it will look like the glass of the screen steams up (maybe something will be written into the steamed up screen), steam goes away after a few seconds (5sec). . When the Snowflakes start dropping a sleigh bell sound is audible for three seconds.
